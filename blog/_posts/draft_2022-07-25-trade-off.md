Preparation for quantum LDPC codes.

Trade-off between asymptotic distance and rate: Hamming bound, Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound, Singleton bound, Plotkin bound.

When singleton bound is achieved, the code is said to be MDS (Maximum Distance Separable). Only possible when q (the alphabet size) is growing with n.

In quantum: bias trade-off.

## Classical error correction

### Hamming bound

### Gilbert-Varshamov bound

### Asymptotically good code

## Quantum error correction
